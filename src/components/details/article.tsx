                We&apos;re building infrastructure that transforms AI from static tools into systems with genuine
                intuition.
            </p>

            <p className="  ">
                AI agents today don&apos;t learn from experience. You can engineer prompts endlessly, but your agents
                won&apos;t build intuition over time. They won&apos;t learn any API edge cases need special handling or
                remember your specialized way of interacting with complex systems.
            </p>

            <p className="  ">
                At Composio, we&apos;re building the infrastructure that enables this. We work with teams, with SGM to
                make it possible.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-4xl font-tinos  text-black/90 ">The Infrastructure for Intuition</h2>

            <p className="  ">
                We&apos;re creating a shared learning infrastructure where every interaction makes the entire ecosystem
                smarter. When one agent masters a tool or discovers an optimal workflow, every agent on our platform
                benefits instantly.
            </p>

            <p className="  ">
                Humans have always built better tools for themselves—adapting from shared experiences - now, we&apos;re
                bringing that advantage to AI at unprecedented speed and scale.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-4xl font-tinos  text-black/90 ">Evolving Skills, Not Static Tools</h2>

            <p className="  ">
                Agents built with Composio don&apos;t just execute tasks, they evolve from a fleet of Waymos, learning
                from each other.
            </p>

            <p className="  ">
                Imagine an agent finding a superior approach to handling complex workflows. It learns from experience.
                Twitter outperforms LinkedIn, prioritize daily coding, and verify meeting schedules. These insights are
                inherited across our platform—no starting from scratch. At Composio agents collectively learn and
                develop real-time.
            </p>

            <p className="  ">
                We&apos;re nowhere close. Building infrastructure for collective AI learning means solving problems no
                one&apos;s cracked yet. How do you capture tacit knowledge from millions of interactions? How do you
                turn single cases into skills across an experienced herd problems. But obvious ones.
            </p>
